# Implementing DAO Structures and Web3 Tools for Conservation: 
# A Briefing Paper for Re:Wild

## Executive Summary

This briefing paper examines the potential for implementing Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) structures and Web3 tools within Re:Wild's global conservation efforts. Through preliminary research and analysis, we have identified significant opportunities for leveraging these emerging technologies to transform conservation funding, governance, and impact measurement.

DAOs offer Re:Wild an innovative approach to address persistent challenges in conservation, including funding limitations, governance complexity, and stakeholder engagement. By implementing blockchain-based organizational structures, Re:Wild could create more transparent, participatory, and financially sustainable conservation models.

Our analysis identifies five key application areas for DAOs within Re:Wild's operations:
1. Project funding and allocation
2. Conservation impact verification and tokenization
3. Community-based conservation governance
4. Conservation tourism management
5. Conservation science coordination

While these applications present substantial opportunities, they also come with significant risks related to regulation, technology, governance, market volatility, and implementation complexity. A strategic approach that begins with carefully designed pilot projects and incorporates robust risk mitigation strategies is recommended.

This paper outlines three practical pilot projects that could be implemented within six months:
1. Conservation Microfinance DAO
2. Biodiversity Monitoring DAO
3. Conservation Land Trust DAO

We recommend beginning with the Conservation Microfinance DAO as the initial implementation, as it has the lowest technical barriers, directly empowers local communities, and requires the smallest budget while demonstrating the core value proposition of DAOs for conservation.

## 1. Introduction and Background

### 1.1 The Conservation Challenge

Biodiversity loss continues at an unprecedented rate globally, with an estimated one million species at risk of extinction. Traditional conservation approaches face persistent challenges:

- Funding limitations and dependency on philanthropic donations
- Difficulty in coordinating global conservation efforts
- Challenges in equitably involving local communities
- Limited mechanisms for verifying and valuing conservation outcomes
- Inefficiencies in resource allocation across conservation priorities

These challenges require innovative solutions that can transform how conservation is funded, governed, and implemented. Emerging technologies, particularly those in the Web3 space, offer potential pathways to address these persistent issues.

### 1.2 The Promise of Web3 for Conservation

Web3 technologies—particularly blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized governance—present opportunities to reimagine conservation models:

- Creating new funding mechanisms beyond traditional philanthropy
- Enabling direct participation in conservation governance
- Providing transparent tracking of conservation funds and impacts
- Tokenizing and creating markets for conservation outcomes
- Facilitating global coordination while empowering local action

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) represent a particularly promising application of these technologies for conservation organizations like Re:Wild.

### 1.3 Purpose and Scope of this Paper

This briefing paper aims to:

1. Provide a clear understanding of DAO structures and Web3 tools relevant to conservation
2. Analyze the potential applications, opportunities, and risks for Re:Wild
3. Outline practical pilot projects that could be implemented within six months
4. Recommend a strategic approach to implementation

The scope encompasses global, regional, and local project-level applications, with a focus on practical implementation rather than theoretical possibilities.

## 2. DAO and Web3 Fundamentals

### 2.1 What are DAOs?

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are internet-native organizations collectively owned and managed by their members. Unlike traditional organizations with hierarchical structures, DAOs use blockchain-based rules (smart contracts) to establish governance and operational parameters.

Key characteristics of DAOs include:

- **Decentralized governance**: Decision-making distributed among members rather than centralized leadership
- **Autonomous operation**: Core functions executed through code rather than human intermediaries
- **Transparency**: All transactions and decisions recorded on public blockchains
- **Token-based membership**: Participation rights typically represented by ownership of governance tokens
- **Community ownership**: Assets and resources collectively owned by the community

DAOs exist on blockchain networks, primarily Ethereum and compatible chains, though they often interface with traditional legal structures for real-world operations.

### 2.2 How DAOs Function

DAOs operate through several core mechanisms:

1. **Smart contracts**: Self-executing code that defines the rules of the organization
2. **Governance tokens**: Digital assets that represent voting rights and ownership
3. **Proposal systems**: Mechanisms for members to suggest actions for the organization
4. **Voting mechanisms**: Systems for collective decision-making, often using quadratic voting or other weighted approaches
5. **Treasuries**: Collectively managed pools of resources (typically cryptocurrencies)

When a DAO is created, its initial rules are programmed as smart contracts deployed to a blockchain. These rules can only be changed through the governance process defined in the contracts themselves, ensuring that no single entity can unilaterally alter the organization's parameters.

### 2.3 Web3 Tools for Conservation

Beyond DAOs, several Web3 tools have particular relevance for conservation:

- **Tokenization**: Converting real-world assets or outcomes (like carbon sequestration or biodiversity protection) into digital tokens that can be tracked, traded, and valued
- **Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**: Unique digital assets that can represent specific conservation areas, endangered species, or conservation achievements
- **Decentralized finance (DeFi)**: Financial instruments built on blockchain that could create new funding mechanisms for conservation
- **Verifiable credentials**: Systems for establishing trusted claims about conservation outcomes
- **Decentralized data storage**: Methods for storing and sharing conservation data in resilient, tamper-proof systems

These tools can be implemented independently or as part of comprehensive DAO structures.

### 2.4 Current State of Conservation DAOs

Several pioneering organizations are already applying DAO structures to conservation challenges:

- **Carbonland DAO**: Focused on acquiring and protecting forest land, with token holders receiving both governance rights and access to protected areas
- **MesoReefDAO**: Working on coral reef conservation through decentralized science (DeSci) and Web3 tools
- **KlimaDAO**: Creating a market for carbon credits on blockchain, with over 20 million carbon credits available through their platform
- **Big Green DAO**: The first non-profit led philanthropic DAO, focused on food justice and sustainable gardening initiatives

These early implementations demonstrate both the potential and the challenges of applying DAO structures to conservation.

## Appendix D: Legal Considerations

### Introduction to Legal Challenges

Implementing DAO structures for conservation presents unique legal challenges at the intersection of blockchain technology, environmental law, nonprofit governance, and international regulations. This appendix outlines key legal considerations that Re:Wild should address when implementing the proposed pilot projects.

### Hybrid Legal Structures

DAOs exist in a legal gray area in most jurisdictions. To bridge this gap, we recommend implementing hybrid legal structures that combine traditional legal entities with DAO governance:

**Recommended Approaches:**
- **DAO LLC**: In jurisdictions that recognize them (e.g., Wyoming, Tennessee, Vermont), establish a DAO LLC that provides limited liability protection while enabling decentralized governance
- **Foundation + DAO**: Establish a traditional nonprofit foundation that interfaces with a DAO, with the foundation holding legal assets and executing decisions made by the DAO
- **Series LLC Structure**: Create a series LLC with separate series for different conservation projects, each governed by its own DAO structure
- **Cooperative Model**: Implement a cooperative legal structure with DAO governance mechanisms for member voting and decision-making

**Key Documentation:**
- Operating agreement that incorporates DAO governance mechanisms
- Terms of service for token holders clearly outlining rights and limitations
- Smart contract code documentation and legal translation
- Governance framework documentation

### Securities Law Considerations

Tokens issued by conservation DAOs may be classified as securities in many jurisdictions, triggering compliance requirements:

**Key Considerations:**
- **Howey Test Analysis**: Evaluate whether tokens meet the criteria of the Howey Test (investment of money in a common enterprise with expectation of profits primarily from others' efforts)
- **Utility vs. Security Tokens**: Design tokens with clear utility functions rather than investment characteristics
- **Jurisdictional Variations**: Consider different regulatory approaches across jurisdictions where token holders may reside
- **Exemptions**: Explore potential exemptions such as Regulation D, Regulation S, or Regulation Crowdfunding in the US

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement KYC/AML procedures for token distributions
- Restrict token sales to accredited investors or qualified purchasers if necessary
- Focus on non-transferable governance rights rather than tradable tokens
- Emphasize conservation impact over financial returns in all communications
- Obtain securities law opinions before token issuance

### Nonprofit and Tax Considerations

As a conservation nonprofit, Re:Wild must navigate specific legal and tax considerations when implementing DAO structures:

**Key Considerations:**
- **Charitable Purpose Alignment**: Ensure DAO activities align with Re:Wild's charitable purpose and mission
